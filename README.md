# MNIST-Tutorial

12/2/2019: 
* Git clone this repo or download the zip.
* Launch Anaconda Navigator and open Jupyter Notebook.
* Open the ipynb file in the cloned folder through Jupyter.
* Read through the details of the notebook.
* Your task: make a separate notebook and copy all the block individually into that notebook.
  you will, above each code block, write a markdown block that explains what the code does. I
  want you to understand the functionality of this basic program, because the same format will
  be used later. Please feel free to experiment with the python code.
